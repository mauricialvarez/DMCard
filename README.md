# Programa de Vantagens DMCard - Landing Page

## Description

This repository contains the source code for the landing page of the "Programa de Vantagens DMCard".

The landing page aims to introduce the DMCard rewards program, present the development team, and collect user feedback and survey data through a contact form.

## Project Context

This project was developed as part of the Tech Challenger for the Pós-Graduação Tech Management at FIAP by the following team members:

*   Guilherme Silva Lima
*   Ivan Ferreira Alexandrino
*   Maurici Dias Alvarez
*   Wander Ribeiro de Chico

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3

## How to View

To view the landing page, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

For example, after cloning:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
# Then open index.html in your browser (e.g., by double-clicking or using a command like 'open index.html' or 'start index.html')
```

## Form Functionality Note

The contact/survey form on this page uses a `mailto:` link. Submitting the form will attempt to open your default email client with the form data pre-filled. For the data to be sent, you will need to complete the sending process through your email client. This method is used for simplicity in this static page demonstration; a production environment would typically use a backend server to process form submissions.
